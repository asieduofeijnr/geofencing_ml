# Geofence Reccommender Project

## Overview
This repository hosts a suite of Python scripts designed for optimizing truck routes and stop locations, with a focus on Geofencing interesteing areas and improving logistical efficiency through Machine Learning, data analysis and visualization.

## Scripts

- **data_preprocessing.py**: Preprocesses GPS and logistic data, preparing it for analysis by cleaning, normalizing, and extracting relevant features.

- **data_cleaning.py**: Ensures data quality by removing outliers, filling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies to maintain analysis reliability.

- **map_visual.py**: Utilizes Streamlit to offer an interactive web application for visualizing truck routes and stops on Folium maps, providing valuable insights into route efficiency and stop locations.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts, clone this repository and ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Dependencies can be installed using:

```sh
streamlit run map_visual.py
```
This project is ongoing and will be updated as and when
